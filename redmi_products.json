The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for \u20b97990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor \u20b98990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than \u20b99000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with \u20b99000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build &amp; looks, crisp and clear screen, loud &amp; crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera.

Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for \u20b97990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor \u20b98990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than \u20b99000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with \u20b99000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build &amp; looks, crisp and clear screen, loud &amp; crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera.

You may be thinking you should get a gaming phone at this price. But it is not.However, the good news is that there are other good phones in this price range if you are looking for a gaming device and especially looking to buy it for playing PUBG. Trust me, do not buy this phone if you are into gaming.So, who should buy the device? Any non-gamer user who loves other aspects of the phone such as a display, battery, camera and so on.DisplayThe display is the most stunning feature of the Samsung M30. It is vibrant and simply stands out. I compared it with my POCO F1 and found it more vibrant, clear and with a punchy contrast. But that doesn't mean POCO F1 display is bad. At 15K, you are getting one heck of a deal when it comes to the display.Another thing that I noticed is the great body to screen ration. It almost covers the whole screen.Processor and RAMAs we said earlier, the processor is not up to mark when it comes to running heavy apps such as games. But for an average user like me and you, who love to do calls, read messages and run the basic application, the phone will be more than enough. It will not go slow while using the available RAM(4GB in my case).Battery5000mAh battery is super awesome! It is another selling point for the phone. If you are looking for a big battery then the phone is for you. Also, the processor and OS are optimized for each other which makes the battery last longer.CameraI didn't test camera that much. But, it does look nice. You can take nice photos. But the camera does not perform best in low light conditions which is okay for a phone priced at 15K.OSI tried Samsung OS for the first time. I found it pretty decent, but not outstanding. You need to navigate multiple times for basic features. But, the good thing is that the UI will help you navigate and you will eventually find the option that you are looking for.In shortDisplay: One of the bestBattery: 5000mAh, more than enough for heavy one day use. Can easily last two days for normal users.Processor + RAM: Great for normal users, not great for gamers.OS: DecentOverall rating: 8.5/10"], ["Shanu siddiqui", "13 March 2019", "1.0 out of 5 stars", "It's just the 3rd day and proximity sensor is not working in this device and ear piece is heating up while on call.
